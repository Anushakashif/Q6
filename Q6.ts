//  5. Stripping Names : Store a person's name, and include some whitespace characters at the begginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each 
// character combination, "\t" and "\n" , at  least once . Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after strippng the white spaces.
